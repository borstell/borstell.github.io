This is true for me, so most people in Sweden address me as Calle (we are very informal with names in Sweden, so feel free to use this form). Calle is pronounced [ˈkʰa᷆lːɛ̂], so yeah, it is also this thing about pitch accent here. Think about the French city Calais or Superman’s real name Kal-El.\nMy last name is tricky even for Swedish speakers, perhaps because it is quite uncommon. However, it is supposed to be pronounced [bœʂˈtɛlː].\nI use Calle also when signing – although I’ve had a number of different name signs over the years (btw, I have a paper on name signs), the ones used most is the sign for DUCK (see video above) because it is also the name sign of Donald Duck (Swedish: Kalle Anka).\n\nIn conclusion: When citing my work, please use Carl, but in all other contexts, do call me Calle!"
