This is true for me, so most people in Sweden address me as Calle (we are very informal with names in Sweden, so feel free to use this form). Calle is pronounced [ˈkʰa᷆lːɛ̂], so yeah, it is also this thing about pitch accent here. Think about the French city Calais or Superman’s real name Kal-El.\nMy last name is tricky even for Swedish speakers, perhaps because it is quite uncommon. However, it is supposed to be pronounced [bœʂˈtɛlː].\nI use Calle also when signing – although I’ve had a number of different name signs over the years (btw, I have a paper on name signs), the ones used most is the sign for DUCK (see video above) because it is also the name sign of Donald Duck (Swedish: Kalle Anka).\n\nIn conclusion: When citing my work, please use Carl, but in all other contexts, do call me Calle!\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Add 2/3 of the beaten egg, and then the flour in batches (preferably sifted), incorporating it into the wet ingredients. When you have a nice fluffy dough, knead for 10 mins, add small amounts of flour if needed. Let rise for 40 mins. \nPunch the dough which should now have doubled in size. Roll out to a quarter inch thick.\nFor lussebullar, follow 3a. For saffron bundles, follow 3b:\n\nCut into long thin strips. Roll each strip towards the middle from one side. Turn the strip over and roll the other end towards the middle until the two rolls meet in an S shape. Place the S shaped buns on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, push a raising into the middle of each spiral roll.\nMake a butter cream by the mixing room temperatured butter with the sugar and spices (optionally add finely chopped raisins and orange zest). Spread butter cream on one half of the rolled out dough, fold the other half of the dough over, flatten, and cut into long thin strips. Wrap strips into knots and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.\n\nSet oven to 250°C (≈480°F). Let the buns rise under a kitchen towel on the baking sheet for 40 mins.\nMake an egg wash with the remainder of the egg (i.e. add a tiny splash of water to it). Brush buns with the egg wash and place in the middle of the oven, reducing the heat to 225°C (≈440°F), and bake for 7—10 mins until golden brown.\nLet the buns cool down on a wire rack under a kitchen towel.\n\n \nImages: Lussekatter (left); Saffron bundles (right)."
