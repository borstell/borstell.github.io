Hello! My name is Calle Börstell.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.500
I work here at Radboud University, Nijmegen.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.200
I have previously worked in general linguistics and sign language linguistics.

In 2017, I graduated with a PhD from Stockholm University, Sweden.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.500
I have previously worked on different sign languages.

For example, Swedish Sign Language, Israeli Sign Language, ABSL, and ASL.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.000
But I mostly focused on Swedish Sign Language.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.000
Linguistic typology.

01:01.500 --> 01:05.000
