Hello! My name is Calle Börstell (sign name DUCK).

00:08.800 --> 00:18.000
I work here at Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

00:18.700 --> 00:23.500
I have previously worked with several different sign languages.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.500
Specifically Swedish Sign Language, Israeli Sign Language, ASL, and ABSL.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
But I mostly focused on Swedish Sign Language.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.500
In 2017, I graduated with a PhD from Stockholm University, Sweden.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
After I graduated I moved here.

00:50.500 --> 00:56.000
Now here at Radboud University, I work as a postdoc –

00:56.300 --> 01:02.000
in the project called <i>"Deaf communication without a shared language"</i>.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.500
My research interests are mainly in four areas:

01:08.000 --> 01:12.500
Sign language linguistics, corpus linguistics, – 

01:13.000 --> 01:17.500
programming, and linguistic typology.
